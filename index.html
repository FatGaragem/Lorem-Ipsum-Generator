<h1 class="display-2 text-center">Lorem Ipsum Generator</h1>
<hr>

<div class="row mx-auto">
    <div class="col">
        <p>Lorem ipsum is a well-known text among design and publishing professionals. 
            It is a poem in Latin, written by Cicero in 45 BC, with the letters scrambled. 
            It is used worldwide to fill spaces in publications before the actual content is inserted.
            You might wonder why a designer would choose to use lorem ipsum text instead of a few paragraphs in their native language. 
            Why not just copy and paste a page from an old book or something?
            The main reason for this is to keep people from focusing on the actual text. When someone creates 
            a template (or uses a free template site) and wants to get feedback on it, they don't want people 
            reviewing it to be distracted by what the text says.
            
            Also, lorem ipsum resembles real text. Copying and pasting the same few words would result in 
            an uneven distribution of letters. With lorem ipsum text, you can focus on how the font and page 
            layout look with near-real copy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <p>Although the lorem ipsum text seems nonsensical, it is actually rooted in a true work in Latin. 
            It comes from Cicero's 45 BC work "De finibus bonorum et malorum" (On the ends of good and evil), which is a look at ethics. The lorem ipsum text comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33.
            However, the common lorem ipsum text we use today is not proper Latin. Compared to Cicero's work, 
            our text lorem ipsum is a nonsensical text. Words that deviate from their initial form have been 
            added, removed and changed.
            The Doctor. Richard McClintock discovered the origin of the text by searching for the rare Latin 
            word "consectetur" in classical literature. His quest appeared in Cicero's work.
            It is unknown who made these changes to the text, or exactly when, to make the mess of words we 
            know today. Sometime in the 1500s, an unknown printer scrambled words that have survived the digital age.</p>
